# ituneslocationfinder

This is a project that takes an iTunes Media Library xml file and analyzes it to find the locations of all the artists according to the MusicBrainz database. It's not perfect, though this seems to be a flaw of MusicBrainz's database and not of the program. This project leverages libpytunes, svg, and musicbrainz api.
